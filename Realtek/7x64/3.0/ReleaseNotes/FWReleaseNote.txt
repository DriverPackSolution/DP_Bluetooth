1. Improve the processing time and flow in feature exchange procedure

Details :
When local device and remote device initate feature exchange simultaneous in noisy environment,
local device has probability to finish one feature exchange procedure too late or reject the 
response pdu from remote device at wrong state. 
When the feature exchange is triggered from the driver via hci read remote features command,
it can cause the driver timeout. This patch can fix the issue and speed up orignal procedure.
