1. Improve the processing time and flow in feature exchange procedure

Details :
When local device and remote device initate feature exchange simultaneous in noisy environment,
local device has probability to finish one feature exchange procedure too late or reject the 
response pdu from remote device at wrong state. 
When the feature exchange is triggered from the driver via hci read remote features command,
it can cause the driver timeout. This patch can fix the issue and speed up orignal procedure.

1.  Improve the processing time and flow for Win8 WHCK test

Details :
For dual mode test, we adjust some processing time and flow to provide 
more bandwidth for LE. For BR/EDR test, fixed an issue with SSP debug mode.

2. Improve the bandwidth utilization to avoid audio skips when using A2DP 
   headset with HID mouse simultaneously

Details :
When user uses some basic rate A2DP headsets and HID devices simultaneously,
the bandwidth cost is too high to operate the application smoothly in original settings.
We improve the bandwidth utilization in this version.

Related Operations/Tests :
use basic rate A2DP headset and HID mouse simultaneously

3. Fixed an issue with headset reconnect in Win8 Bluetooth MS stack

Details :
During HW Radio Off/On or S3/S4 to S0, some headsets maybe can not be reconnected
or audio player can not be played automatically because Win8 Bluetooth Stack
does not receive excepted event packet. We fix an issue about this.

Related Operations/Tests :
connect the headset and play music then HW Radio Off/On or S3/S4 to S0 

Affected Devices :

1. Fixed an issue with A2DP reconnect after resume from S3 in 
   Win8 Bluetooth MS stack

Details :
During S3 to S0, some headsets maybe can not be reconnected or audio player 
can not be played automatically because Win8 Bluetooth Stack can not finish
some procedures before enter S3. We fix an issue about this.

Related Operations/Tests :
connect the headset and play music from S3 to S0

Affected Devices :
----------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Improve Win8 WHCK dual mode test in noisy environment

Details :
Some criterion of Win8 WHCK test cases can not pass easily in noisy environment.
We adjust some procedure and guarantee bandwidth for dual mode to help pass test 
cases more easily.
